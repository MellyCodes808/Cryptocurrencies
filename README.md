# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis is to investigate cryptocurrencies in the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investments.

The Data was not not ideal, so I proceesed it with Pandas to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output I decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I used on a clustering algorithm (K-Means) and used data visualizations to share findings.
